## UAT re-run with the leak fix — 2026-06-09 (validation_open) — Outcome C: data-shape gate PASSES

After `fix/silver-gate-storage-bin-stock-at-location` (gating `stock_at_location` + `storage_bin`), the
full UAT chain was re-run under `validation_open` (redeploy → Silver slow→fast → Gold → validation_open
secured + serving + consumption views). **All 7 consumption views now scope correctly — the `overview` /
`im_wm_reconciliation` leak is gone:**

| view | rows | distinct plant_id |
|---|---|---|
| overview | 2 | **2 (C061+P817)** ✓ — was 133 |
| im_wm_reconciliation | 4,497 | **2** ✓ — was 327 |
| inbound_backlog | 31,327 | 2 ✓ |
| outbound_backlog | 116,695 | 2 ✓ |
| shortfalls | 22 | 2 ✓ |
| staging_workload | 0 | — (source `gold_process_order_staging` 0) |
| stock_exceptions | 0 | — (source `gold_stock_expiry_risk` 0) |

Silver fix targets confirmed gated in UAT: `stock_at_location` 30,105/2 plants, `storage_bin` 15,506/2
plants. **Outcome C** — the UAT **data-shape gate passes** (all 7 views create + correctly plant-scoped via
`validation_open`). NOT proven: RLS/entitlement (validation_open is data-shape only; the `users` consumer
group is absent in the UAT metastore → consumer-grant + harden = the separate Gate B/C step). No app
cutover; no source-mode change. UAT deployment torn down afterwards (schemas dropped). Next: Gate B/C —
reconcile the `users` consumer group + provide representative test identities.

## Revalidation — 2026-06-09 (after Silver stage-gate fixes #58/#60/#62/#63) — Outcome A (partial)

Full UAT rerun after the stage-gate hardening: first-time redeploy (`mode:production`, profile DEFAULT,
warehouse `e76480b94bea6ed5`), Silver slow (`78186be0`) → fast (`9778d1a2`) → Gold (`d89c0d1b`), then
`validation_open` security + serving + consumption + generated contract-validation SQL. Deployment torn
down afterwards (both io-reporting schemas dropped); UAT left clean.

**Silver stage-gate — FIXED and proven (the #58 regression check passes).** The 6 operational tables
checked in this run (a subset of the full ENFORCED set in `silver_stage_gate_inventory.yml`) are now
scoped to exactly the two onboarded plants (C061 + P817) — the 640-plant / 18.8M-row `purchase_order`
leak is gone:

| Silver table | rows | distinct plants |
|---|---|---|
| purchase_order | 184,553 | **2 (C061+P817)** ✓ |
| outbound_delivery | 820,799 | 2 ✓ |
| reservation_requirement | 3,222,700 | 2 ✓ |
| physical_inventory_document | 140,658 | 2 ✓ |
| handling_unit | 672,525 | 2 ✓ |
| warehouse_transfer_requirement | 1,665,526 | 2 ✓ |

**Warehouse mapping — correct (T320):** `warehouse_storage_location_mapping` gives **C061→104, P817→208**
(the prior C061→208 seed bug is gone); `site_config_plant` active = C061 + P817.

**Consumption views — all 7 CREATE through the `*_secured` boundary**, but 2 still LEAK all plants:

| view | rows | distinct plant_id | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| inbound_backlog | 31,327 | 2 | created-and-valid-shape ✓ |
| outbound_backlog | 116,695 | 2 | created-and-valid-shape ✓ |
| shortfalls | 22 | 2 | created-and-valid-shape ✓ |
| staging_workload | 0 | — | created-empty (source `gold_process_order_staging` = 0) |
| stock_exceptions | 0 | — | created-empty (source `gold_stock_expiry_risk` = 0) |
| **overview** | 133 | **133** | **created-with-data-quality-issue — LEAK** |
| **im_wm_reconciliation** | 204,177 | **327** | **created-with-data-quality-issue — LEAK** |

**Root cause of the residual leak:** `#58` gated the inbound/outbound/process-order/reservation operational
flows, but two Gold models read silver tables that are still `NEEDS_MAPPING` (ungated):
- `gold_warehouse_kpi_snapshot` (→ overview) reads **`storage_bin`** (ungated, warehouse axis).
- `gold_warehouse_exceptions` (→ im_wm_reconciliation) reads **`stock_at_location`** (ungated, plant axis,
  MARD.WERKS) and **`storage_bin`**.
So those two views inherit all-plant scope. The fix is to gate `storage_bin` (warehouse axis, via
`active_warehouses_df` / T320) and `stock_at_location` (plant axis, MARD.WERKS) and reclassify them
ENFORCED — a scoped follow-up `fix(silver)` PR.

**Schema/types — pass:** `inbound_backlog.ordered_qty` = DECIMAL, `inbound_backlog.po_date` = DATE,
`shortfalls.shortfall_qty` = DECIMAL (the #54/#55/#57 decimal/date fixes hold).

**Security / RLS — NOT proven (and NOT a data-shape blocker).** Used `validation_open` — the mode built
precisely to run UAT data-shape validation WITHOUT the corporate Unity Catalog security model. The
`*_secured` views were created (pass-throughs) and all data-shape evidence above was gathered by querying
as the object owner, so the run did not depend on UC security. A separate finding — **the `users` consumer
group does not exist in this UAT metastore** (`PRINCIPAL_DOES_NOT_EXIST` on every `GRANT … TO users` and
the harden `REVOKE … FROM users`) — therefore did **not** block data-shape validation; it only affects the
consumer grant + base-table harden, which belong to the **Gate B/C / production-security / cutover** step,
not Gate A. RLS/entitlement remains unproven (validation_open proves data shape only).

**Outcome A (partial) — the data-shape blocker is now fixed.** The residual `overview` (133) +
`im_wm_reconciliation` (327) leak (ungated `storage_bin`/`stock_at_location`) is **fixed in
`fix/silver-gate-storage-bin-stock-at-location`** and DEV-validated (both views → 2 plants; gold_warehouse_
kpi_snapshot/exceptions → 2 plants). After that fix, a UAT re-run under `validation_open` is expected to
pass the data-shape gate for all 7 views. Remaining for the **RLS/cutover gate (B/C), not data-shape:**
reconcile the `users` consumer group + provide test identities. No app cutover; no source-mode change.

## (2026-06-08) First UAT validation attempt — did NOT complete

> [!WARNING]
> **This earlier attempt did NOT complete, and RLS/entitlement was NOT proven** (superseded by the
> 2026-06-09 revalidation above for the stage-gate result). No app cutover decision can be made from it.

## Execution metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date/time | 2026-06-08 |
| Workspace | `adb-604667594731808.8.azuredatabricks.net` (UAT) |
| Catalog / schema | `connected_plant_uat` / `gold_io_reporting` (+ `silver_io_reporting`) |
| SQL warehouse | `connected_plant_uat` (id `e76480b94bea6ed5`) |
| Bundle target | `uat` (mode: **production**) |
| Executed by | `tim.geldard@kerry.com` (profile `DEFAULT`) |
| Gold pipeline | not run (blocked — see below) |

## What was run

This was a **first-time deployment** of the io-reporting Silver+Gold stack to UAT — no
`silver_io_reporting` / `gold_io_reporting` schema or pipelines existed beforehand.

1. `databricks bundle deploy -t uat` — created 4 pipelines + 4 jobs.
2. **Silver Reference (slow)** pipeline — completed (~6 min); built `site_config_*`, reference data.
3. **Silver Fast (continuous)** pipeline — started; partial C061-scoped backfill, then **stopped**.
4. Gold pipeline, security/harden SQL, serving + consumption views, contract-validation SQL — **NOT run.**
5. The deployment was **torn down** (`bundle destroy -t uat` + dropped both io-reporting schemas), leaving
   UAT in its pre-deploy state.

## Findings

### A. Stage-gate leak (BLOCKER — fixed) — `fix/warehouse360-stage-gate-inbound-outbound-p817`

Several operational Silver flows were **not plant-gated** and materialised all plants:

| Silver table | UAT result | Expected (C061-gated) |
|---|---|---|
| `purchase_order` | **640 plants / 18.8M rows** (ungated) | C061 only |
| `outbound_delivery`, `reservation_requirement` | ungated (not yet backfilled when stopped) | C061 only |
| `physical_inventory_document`, `handling_unit` | ungated | C061 only |
| `goods_movement` | 4.34M rows, **C061 only** ✓ | C061 only |
| `process_order` | 224k rows, **C061 only** ✓ | C061 only |
| `batch_stock` | 684k rows, **C061 only** ✓ | C061 only |

The gated tables (`goods_movement`/`process_order`/`batch_stock`) confirm the gate mechanism works; the
ungated tables (`inbound.py`, `warehouse_flow.py`) were classified `NEEDS_MAPPING` (backlog), so the
coverage guard did not catch them. Fixed by gating them and reclassifying `ENFORCED`.

### B. Warehouse→plant config bug (fixed in the same PR)

The stage-gate seed mis-mapped **C061 → warehouse 208**. SAP T320 (`warehouseforplant_t320`) and T300
(`warehousemaster_t300`) confirm **C061 → 104**, and **208 belongs to P817** (Jackson [MFG], US). The
warehouse gate now derives the relationship from T320 (not the hand-maintained seed); the seed and the
`storage_type_role_mapping` APPROVED set were corrected; **P817 (Jackson [MFG], US) was onboarded.**

### C. RLS / entitlement NOT proven — needs the validation security modes + test identities

The secured views filter on `current_user()` against `published_uat.security.model` (owner
`jens.michels@kerry.com`). The validating user has **read (`SELECT`) access** to that table (via
`grp_admin_connected_plant_uat`) but **no write access**, and — as the deployer — **owns the Gold
objects**. Therefore RLS/entitlement cannot be proven by this user:

- Cannot provision representative test-identity rows (no write to `published_uat.security.model`).
- Cannot observe the "`users` group lacks base-table SELECT" negative (the deployer is the owner, not a
  `users`-group member).

> UAT governed-view validation could not prove RLS/entitlement because **write access to
> `published_uat.security.model` is unavailable to the validating user, and the deployer owns the Gold
> objects** (so neither the positive plant-scoping case nor the base-table-revoke negative can be observed
> from this session). The governed secured-view boundary remains mandatory. **No app cutover decision can
> be made from this result.**

This motivates explicit **UAT validation security modes** (`validation_open` for data-shape validation
without the corporate security model; `validation_fixture` for representative entitlement testing with a
local fixture) — see `docs/runbooks/warehouse360-uat-migration-readiness.md`.

## Outcome — Outcome A (blockers found), now remediated; re-validation pending

- Findings A and B are fixed in `fix/warehouse360-stage-gate-inbound-outbound-p817` (not yet
  runtime-validated — the slow-tier `inbound.py` gate needs a DEV pipeline run to confirm DLT ordering).
- Data-shape validation of the 7 consumption views was **not completed** (Gold/views/validation SQL not
  run). It should be re-attempted after the gate fix is DEV-validated, using `validation_open` mode so it
  does not depend on the corporate security model.
- RLS/entitlement remains **not proven** — requires non-owner test identities provisioned in
  `published_uat.security.model` by its owner, or fixture-based testing.

## Next gate

1. DEV pipeline run to validate the stage-gate fix (gate ordering + C061-only scope for the newly-gated
   flows; P817 if DEV onboards it).
2. Re-deploy + run UAT, then run Gate A (data-shape, `validation_open`) once the security modes exist.
3. Gate B (fixture RLS) / Gate C (strict RLS with `published_uat.security.model`) for entitlement proof.
